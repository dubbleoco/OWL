Dead simple. A basic web app or iOS/Android app could do this today with zero hardware.\n- **OBD2 version:** Bluetooth OBD2 dongle ($20\u201350) + app = real fuel consumption data. Calculate cost-per-mile in real time, factor against time value.\n- **Score engine:** Over a trip or week, score based on consistency, avoiding idle, minimizing hard accelerations. Think fitness tracker but for driving.\n\n**Differentiation:**\n- The miles-per-minute frame is genuinely novel for consumer apps.\n- Score + historical tracking is what creates habit/stickiness.\n- Could target commercial drivers (delivery, Uber/Lyft) as a niche where time-efficiency has direct dollar value.\n\n**For Neall:** You could MVP this as a web calculator in a day \u2014 just speed \u2192 miles per min conversion with a simple UI. No OBD2 needed to validate the concept. If people find it interesting, then build out.\n\n**Honest take:** Interesting frame, underserved niche, technically accessible MVP path. Not a $10M app idea, but it could be a solid small app with a specific audience. Worth building a calculator MVP to test resonance.\n\n**First 3 steps:**\n1. Build a single-page web app: input speed, see miles-per-minute, estimated arrival time at that pace. Ship it. Share it.\n2. Gauge reaction \u2014 does anyone find the reframe interesting/useful?\n3. If yes, add OBD2 integration and score history. If meh, park it.\n\nTags: #app #driving #automotive #productivity #tech #mvp\nStatus: DONE"

    "content": "Agent that monitors Steelhead Alley conditions for anglers: Runs a social media account to post daily updates about fishing conditions, tips, and local news.\n\n### PROCESSED 01:35\n**What is Steelhead Alley:** The Lake Erie tributaries in northeastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania \u2014 Chagrin River, Grand River, Rocky River, Vermilion River, Cattaraugus Creek. Famous for fall/winter/spring steelhead runs. Roughly 3\u20134 hours from Chelsea.\n\n**The actual idea:** Build an agent that pulls real-time data from USGS stream gauges, weather APIs, and maybe forum/social scraping \u2014 then auto-posts daily condition reports to Instagram/X. Think \"is it worth the 4-hour drive today?\"\n\n**Current landscape:**\n- Existing accounts post conditions but they're manual, inconsistent, or guide-shop driven (biased toward \"yeah come fish, buy a guide trip\").\n- USGS has public APIs for flow, gauge height, and water temp on all major tributaries \u2014 free data.\n- There's real demand for a neutral, automated, daily \"river report\" that anglers can trust.\n\n**Technical feasibility for Neall:**\n- This is an OpenClaw-native idea. You're literally running an agent right now.\n- USGS waterservices.usgs.gov API is public, no key needed \u2014 query flow CFS and gauge height for any station.\n- Pull National Weather Service API for upcoming precip (high water/muddy = bad; dropping from a spike = prime).\n- Format a daily post, auto-publish via Instagram Graph API or Buffer/Zapier.\n\n**Revenue model:**\n- Gear affiliate links (Trout Unlimited partners, local fly shops)\n- Guide service promoted posts\n- Merch (hats, stickers \u2014 something simple)\n- Could monetize modestly at 5K\u201320K followers\n\n**For Neall specifically:** Your fly fishing background gives you the credibility to write the condition summaries with real context. You know what \"dropping from 800 CFS to 350 with clearing visibility\" means. That's the secret sauce an automated account without a human voice lacks.\n\n**Honest take:** One of the stronger ideas in this batch. Technically buildable with what you already have, serves a community you're already part of, low startup cost, real monetization path. Build it.\n\n**First 3 steps:**\n1. Set up an Instagram account (e.g., @steelheaddaily or @steelheadconditions) and claim the name.\n2. Query the USGS API for 3-4 key Steelhead Alley gauges \u2014 test in terminal, confirm data quality.\n3. Build a simple daily cron script that fetches gauge data + weather, formats a condition summary, and queues a post. MVP in a weekend.\n\nTags: #fly-fishing #agent #automation #steelhead #social-media #michigan-adjacent #build-this\nStatus: DONE"

    "content": "Device that tracks lean angle on a mountain bike: Helps riders improve their cornering technique by providing real-time feedback and data analysis.\n\n### PROCESSED 01:35\n**Core concept:** A sensor-based device (or app) that captures lean angle while mountain biking to help riders analyze and improve cornering technique.\n\n**What already exists:**\n- Some high-end GPS computers (Garmin Edge with IMU) log lean angle but it's buried in data, not the focus.\n- Motorcycle world has this well-covered (Bosch MSC, Ducati Cornering ABS \u2014 but those are $30K+ bikes).\n- MTB-specific lean angle as a training metric: **genuinely underserved.** Closest thing is Shockwiz (suspension tuning sensor) \u2014 not lean angle.\n- Apps like Strava and TrailForks capture GPS/speed, not lean angle.\n\n**Technical feasibility:**\n- A phone mounted to the handlebars with an accelerometer + gyroscope *can* estimate lean angle \u2014 but handlebar lean \u2260 true body/bike lean in a corner. Frame-mounted would be more accurate.\n- An IMU (inertial measurement unit) module like a BNO055 or MPU-6050 is $3\u2013$10 and pairs with a microcontroller (ESP32, ~$5) via Bluetooth to a phone. Totally prototypable.\n- 3D-printed housing = right in your wheelhouse, Neall.\n\n**Market:**\n- MTB tech accessories are growing. Riders are data nerds. A device that tells you \"your avg lean angle in that berm was 32\u00b0, max was 47\u00b0\" would be legitimately useful for skills progression.\n- Target: enduro/trail riders, bike skills coaches, progression-focused riders.\n\n**The build path:**\n- Phase 1: IMU module + ESP32 + 3D-printed mount \u2192 Bluetooth to a phone app (MIT App Inventor or React Native)\n- Phase 2: App with ride recording, lean angle graphs, session comparison\n- Phase 3: Hardware product (crowdfund? Etsy prototype sales?)\n\n**Honest take:** This has more legs than most ideas. You have the hardware skills (fabrication), the personal context (MTB interest), and the market need is real. The software side is the gap \u2014 you'd need a dev partner or learn enough to build a basic BLE app. Worth prototyping.\n\n**First 3 steps:**\n1. Order an IMU module and ESP32 ($15 total) \u2014 get it logging raw angle data strapped to your bike frame.\n2. Validate the data quality \u2014 does it produce meaningful lean angle readings on trails?\n3. Share raw concept with MTB communities (Reddit r/MTB, local trail groups) for feedback before building further.\n\nTags: #mtb #hardware #3dprinting #dubble-o #product #tech #fitness\nStatus: DONE"

That's the novelty. On Waterloo Rd near the Waterloo Recreation Area (state forest, campgrounds, hiking, MTB trails), you'd catch summer campers, hikers, and fall hunters.\n\n**Traffic reality check:** Waterloo Rd isn't a high-throughput corridor like M-52 or I-94. Foot/car traffic is seasonal and activity-dependent. Summer and fall are your windows. Dead in winter.\n\n**What you need to legally operate in Michigan:**\n- **Temporary Food Establishment permit** from the local health department (Washtenaw or Jackson County depending on exact location) \u2014 typically $100\u2013$300/season.\n- **Peddler's license** from the township/county.\n- **Cottage food laws** don't cover boiled peanuts (they're not baked goods) \u2014 you'll need a proper commissary or on-site setup.\n- A propane burner, large stockpot, and cooler setup is your equipment. All-in: $300\u2013$600.\n\n**Startup costs:** Very low. Raw peanuts in bulk ~$1\u20132/lb. Boiled peanuts sell for $3\u20136/bag. Margins are decent if volume is there.\n\n**Flavor differentiation:** Cajun, Old Bay, garlic, sweet/honey \u2014 experimentation is cheap and that variety creates repeat customers.\n\n**Honest take:** This is a low-risk, low-cost experiment \u2014 maybe $500\u20131,000 all-in to test one summer. The novelty factor is real in Michigan where nobody's doing this. Could become a thing. Could also be crickets. Small enough bet to just try it.\n\n**First 3 steps:**\n1. Call Washtenaw County Environmental Health \u2014 get clarity on permit requirements and fees.\n2. Scout the exact spot on Waterloo Rd for visibility, pullover space, and proximity to the park entrances.\n3. Start with one weekend in June.

Works great for motocross events (BermSnap connection), local causes, sports teams. Low overhead, solid PR, proven community engagement. You'd need a location with water access, signage, volunteers, and a cause people care about.\n\n**Version B \u2014 Standalone business:** This is where it gets complicated. Zoning issues in Michigan (outdoor commercial activities), seasonal limitations, potential HR/liability headaches if employees are involved. Not a sustainable model in Chelsea.\n\n**Best fit for Neall:** Version A, event-based. You've got BermSnap events where there's already a crowd and community energy. A charity bikini wash as a side event at a moto race could generate buzz and donations simultaneously. Could also tie to your social media/content creation skills for organic reach.\n\n**Honest take:** Not a business, but a great event. Keep it in the \"fun activation\" column, not the \"revenue stream\" column.\n\n**First 3 steps (if pursuing as event):**\n1. Pick a cause/charity that resonates with the moto community.\n2. Coordinate with a race organizer to integrate it into an upcoming BermSnap event.\n3. Handle permitting \u2014 temporary event permits, water access permission, and any local municipality requirements.\n\nTags: #event #fundraiser #bermsnap #automotive #community\nStatus: DONE"

Strict requirements \u2014 must prove facilities, training, vet access.\n- **Michigan DNR Wildlife Rehabilitation License:** Also required. Must complete training, pass requirements, work under a licensed mentor first.\n- Both permits together mean this isn't a \"start next month\" project \u2014 plan 6\u201318 months just to get licensed.\n\n**Existing Michigan competition/partners to know:**\n- **Leslie Science & Nature Center (Ann Arbor):** Has a raptor center with resident non-releasable birds \u2014 owls, hawks. Only ~15 min from Chelsea.\n- **Howell Nature Center:** Active wildlife rehab including raptors, ~20 min from Chelsea.\n- **Kalamazoo Nature Center:** Raptor program further west.\n\n**Startup costs:**\n- Flight cages/mews: $5K\u2013$50K depending on scale and materials.\n- Vet partnerships: A licensed wildlife vet must be on your team/on-call.\n- Ongoing: prey animals (mice, quail), housing, utilities, supplies. Budget $10K\u2013$30K/yr operating minimum.\n\n**Revenue model:**\n- Education programs: school visits, scout groups, paid presentations\n- Grants: state/federal wildlife conservation grants, NWTF, Raptor Research Foundation\n- Events: hawk watch programs, bird of prey flight demonstrations\n\n**Honest take:** This is a passion project, not a business. Deeply rewarding if raptors are your thing, but it's regulatory-heavy, costly, and the path to doing it right starts with volunteering at Leslie or Howell for 1\u20132 years to get hands-on experience and mentor hours required for your own permit. If this is calling to you, start there.\n\n**For Neall specifically:** Connects to your outdoor/fly fishing identity and love of Michigan wildlife. Could pair with your photography skills (Canon R6) for content and grant applications. Don't go in expecting it to generate income for several years.\n\n**First 3 steps:**\n1. Contact Leslie Science & Nature Center \u2014 volunteer as a raptor handler. Get the experience and mentor relationship.\n2. Complete Michigan DNR wildlife rehab training course.\n3. Apply for USFWS permit once you have required experience hours.\n\nTags: #raptor #wildlife #conservation #michigan #outdoor #passion-project\nStatus: DONE"

There's Hubba Bubba blueberry, some specialty/novelty brands, and occasional limited releases. But blueberry is notably absent from the mainstream functional gum aisle \u2014 no Trident blueberry, no Orbit blueberry. Mint dominates (~60%+ of gum sales), followed by fruit blends and cinnamon.\n\n**Market reality check:** The gum category has been declining for ~15 years. US gum sales peaked around 2010 and have dropped roughly 30%+ since. The market is consolidating around Mondelez (Trident, Dentyne, Stride) and Mars Wrigley (Extra, Orbit, Eclipse). Hard to enter this space as a standalone product.\n\n**Where there IS a gap:** Functional gum (caffeinated, CBD, vitamin-infused) is the growth segment. A blueberry-flavored nootropic or energy gum could combine the novel flavor with a functional hook. That's a different play than just \"blueberry flavored.\"\n\n**Manufacturing:** Private-label gum manufacturers exist (Lotte, Perfetti Van Melle contract divisions, US private labelers), but minimums are steep \u2014 typically 50,000+ units per SKU. Not a small-batch-friendly category like 3D printing or laser cutting.\n\n**Honest take:** As a standalone flavor extension into a dying category with high manufacturing minimums \u2014 tough. Low enthusiasm from this owl. BUT if this is a novelty gift product angle (like Sock Riot territory \u2014 curated gift boxes with themed items), a blueberry gum sourced wholesale and bundled into a gift set is viable without manufacturing anything.\n\n**First 3 steps (if still interested):**\n1. Source existing blueberry gum wholesale and test demand via Sock Riot-style bundles.\n2. If there's real traction, explore private label minimum quotes.\n3. Consider the functional angle (blueberry + brain/focus claims) as a differentiated hook.\n\nTags: #product #gum #food #consumer-goods\nStatus: DONE"

Touchless = no contact, foam + high-pressure rinse only.\n\n**Two very different business models:**\n- **Fixed-site tunnel:** $500K\u2013$3M+ to build. Land, equipment, permits, utilities. This is a real business but a serious capital commitment.\n- **Mobile concierge (the smarter starting point):** Pressure washer + foam cannon + deionized water system. $5K\u2013$25K to start. You go to the customer \u2014 driveway, office parking lot, car shows, storage facilities.\n\n**Market:** Ann Arbor/Chelsea corridor has solid luxury vehicle density \u2014 medical professionals, tech folks, UM crowd. Touchless is actually undersold here. Most car washes in that area are brush or soft-cloth. A concierge mobile service has real whitespace.\n\n**Competitors to watch:** Mister Car Wash (big chain, not premium), local detailers (most use contact methods). True touchless mobile concierge = thin competition locally.\n\n**Key differentiators for success:**\n- Subscription model (monthly wash packages)\n- Add-ons: ceramic coating, paint protection film prep, interior detailing\n- White-glove positioning \u2014 appointment-based, they don't wait in line\n\n**Honest take:** Mobile version is a legit side hustle you could validate cheaply. Fixed site is a whole different beast \u2014 don't go there without $1M+ and an operator background. The mobile angle fits your service mindset and equipment sensibility.\n\n**First 3 steps:**\n1. Decide mobile vs. fixed. Mobile is the obvious starting point.\n2. Price-check equipment: foam cannon, pressure washer (cold/hot), DI water tank setup. All-in budget under $10K to start small.\n3.
